For a long time I've been experiencing a very noticeable shift in the way that I think. When I say this I am talking about this on a literal level, I mean it. Its not just _what I think_, or how I form my opinions, or what those opinions are, its a deliberate adjustment to my natural way of interpreting the world to align with consistent but ever surprising results or feedback I get from the world when I do change things.

If I think hard about it (ironic) there are a few examples I can present:

- Recognising what people mean when they ask "why"
- Some others I ironically cannot remember right this minute
