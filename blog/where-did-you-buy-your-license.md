In the UK, more and more people seem to be driving incorrectly, especially where it matters most, such as on faster roads or duel carriageways.

This is less about the actual skill or technique involved in the literal driving or control of motor vehicles but more a few behaviors which are effectively large flashing neon signs above such motorists that declare that they are a fucking moron. These include:

- Undertaking
- Failing to indicate
- Using the "overtaking lane" as one's personal race track

Whether or not a motorist will decide to indicate seems to be completely arbitrary and random, but there does seem to be some level of decision making taking place as to whether they will indicate before moving in their desired direction.
