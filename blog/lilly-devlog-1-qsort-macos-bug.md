# [Lilly](https://github.com/tauraamui/lilly) Devlog - 1

## Introduction

I have been working on a project for nearly a year which I see as my (and perhaps others?) alternative or entire replacement of Neovim for day to day work.
## A quick look into an elusive bug

### Sorting file paths by search term match

The Lilly editor (LE) has a core feature which is called the "file picker". This lists all of the files available within the current "workspace", and the list is ordered based on the closest match to the searched name.
