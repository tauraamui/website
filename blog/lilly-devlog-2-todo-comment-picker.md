The Lilly project feature set target is based on my personal existing Neovim configuration. This is to say that all of the functionality and behaviour of Neovim as I have configured it is the target goal for the Lilly editor project.

One main feature that I want to re-create from my Neovim setup is the functionality of a plugin called "todo comments".
