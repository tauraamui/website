         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <p>I have been working on a project for nearly a year which I see as my (and perhaps others?) alternative or entire replacement of Neovim for day to day work.</p>
         <h2>A quick look into an elusive bug</h2>
         <h3>Sorting file paths by search term match</h3>
         <p>The Lilly editor (LE) has a core feature which is called the &quot;file picker&quot;. This lists all of the files available within the current &quot;workspace&quot;, and the list is ordered based on the closest match to the searched name.</p>
