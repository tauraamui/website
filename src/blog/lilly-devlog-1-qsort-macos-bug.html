         <p>I have been working on a project for nearly a year which I see as my (and perhaps others?) alternative or entire replacement of Neovim for day to day work. This editor is in the pre-alpha release stage of the project. As such there is currently no commitment to provide frequent or consistent dev logs or change log summaries. With that being said, I recently encountered for the first time a bug which I feel is worth writing an article about.</p>
         <p>I will hopefully provide useful insight in this post into what the bug was, how it manifested in Lilly, and what the journey to fix it looked like.</p>
         <h2>What bug?</h2>
         <p>The Lilly editor (LE) has a core feature which is called the &quot;file picker&quot;. This lists all of the files available within the current &quot;workspace&quot;, and the list is ordered based on the closest match to the searched name. This makes navigating a familiar &quot;workspace&quot; very quick and simple, once you can see the file you are wanting to edit, you can then select it with the arrow keys and hit <code>RETURN</code> to open it.</p>
         <p><img src="/static/lilly-editor-file-picker-sorting.gif" alt="lilly-file-picker"></p>
         <p>On Linux and Windows, this feature worked fine. On Mac, everything seemed to be broken. Instead of sorting the full list, only the top entry would randomly change, but what was pushed to the top didn't match whatsoever with the search query either. But the tests were all passing, and the language and its std libraries are the same across all platforms? Right?</p>
         <h2>How does the sorting work?</h2>
         <p>A standard library function called <code>dice_coefficient</code> within the V(lang) module <code>strings</code> is used to generate a score for each entry in the list. The higher the score, the closer the match to the search query. These scores range from <code>0.0</code> to <code>1.0</code>. The file picker code uses this score to order the file path list, the higher the score, the higher in the list it will appear.</p>
         <p>The V(lang) modules documentation has this note regarding this function:</p>
         <blockquote>
         <p><code>dice_coefficient</code> implements the Sørensen–Dice coefficient. It finds the similarity between two strings, and returns a coefficient between 0.0 (not similar) and 1.0 (exact match). <a target='_blank' href="https://modules.vlang.io/strings.html#dice_coefficient">module documentation</a></p>
         </blockquote>
         <p>Therefore, the full name of the underlying algorithm Lilly uses to compare one string of text with another is &quot;Sørensen–Dice coefficient&quot; (SDC).</p>
         <details> <summary>Slightly off topic (click to expand) </summary>
         <h3>Sørensen–Dice coefficient vs Levenshtein Distance</h3>
         <p>This is slightly off topic for this article, but as a point of interest in case you were wondering, yes, there are also functions to calculate the &quot;Levenshtein Distance&quot; (LD) between two strings available within the V(lang) standard library. I have some intuitive sense that of the two options, LD is more well known and more &quot;popular&quot;, and you may be wondering why LD wasn't chosen as the algorithm instead of SDC.</p>
         <p>According to others research I found online, SDC is better optimised for sets of strings which are lengthy, or vary wildly in length from each other, and sets where there is a greater chance of more errors than matches.</p>
         <p>Lists of file paths of an arbitrary length, which are all being compared to a single very specific lookup &quot;query&quot; matches the kind of situation that SDC is better suited for, as its optimised for this, compared to something like (LD).</p>
         <p>Incidentally the V compiler uses (LD) to try and provide alternative function or type names in the case of a function reference or invocation being undefined, as its highly likely that the intended function has been simply misspelt.</p>
         <p>For example:</p>
         <pre><code class="language-v">
         src/view.v:35:12: error: unknown type `Cursorx`.
         Did you mean `Cursor`?
            33 | }
            34 |
            35 | fn (cursor Cursorx) line_is_within_selection(line_y int) bool {
         </code></pre>
         <p>This is an optimal use of the (LD) algorithm over (SDC), as its only matching at most a couple of verbs/strings, they're very likely to be fairly short and there's a good chance that in the case of a misspelling there's probably only a few incorrect or missing characters.</p>
         </details>
         <p>Being able to score each file path against the query is the first piece of the puzzle, but it is not sufficient to provide us the ability to actually order a list of file paths in score order. In order to do sorting we need a sorting algorithm.</p>
         <h3>The sorting algorithm</h3>
         <p>Within the V(lang) programming language, native built-in types have utility methods available on them. The array type is the native list type of the language, and it has a method for sorting in-place, called <code>sort_with_compare</code>.</p>
         <p>The V(lang) modules documentation has this note regarding this method:</p>
         <blockquote>
         <p><code>sort_with_compare</code> sorts the array in-place using the results of the given function to determine sort order. The function should return one of three values:- <code>-1</code> when <code>a</code> should come before <code>b</code> ( <code>a &lt; b</code>). Return should be <code>1</code> when <code>b</code> should come before <code>a</code> (<code>b &lt; a</code>) or <code>0</code> when the order cannot be determined (<code>a == b</code>)</p>
         </blockquote>
         <p>It also provides an example (this will be important later):</p>
         <pre><code class="language-v">
         fn main() {
             mut a := ['hi', '1', '5', '3']
             a.sort_with_compare(fn (a &amp;string, b &amp;string) int {
                 if a &lt; b {
                     return -1
                 }
                 if a &gt; b {
                     return 1
                 }
                 return 0
             })
             assert a == ['1', '3', '5', 'hi']
         }
         </code></pre>
         <h3>What we have so far:</h3>
         <p>The steps:</p>
         <ol>
         <li>The file list is loaded as is from the raw list contained within the <code>workspace</code> instance in Lilly.<pre><code class="language-v">files := [&quot;./src/main.v&quot;, &quot;./src/lib/clipboard/clipboard.v&quot;, &quot;./src/editor.v&quot;]
         </code></pre>
         </li>
         <li>We invoke <code>sort_with_compare</code> on the file list directly. This will order the entries in the list based on the <code>1</code> or <code>0</code> or <code>-1</code> return value from the callback passed in this step<pre><code class="language-v">
         query := &quot;clip&quot;
         files.sort_with_compare(fn [query] (a &amp;string, b &amp;string) int {
             a_score := dice_coefficient(query, a)
             b_score := dice_coefficient(query, b)
         
             if a_score &lt; b_score { return 1 }
             if b_score &gt; a_score { return -1 }
             return 0
         })
         </code></pre>
         </li>
         <li>The list contents is then sorted into descending order, with the closest query match at the top, with the more distant matches below that.</li>
         </ol>
         <h2>Discovery of the bug on macOS</h2>
         <p>The file picker works! At least it does on Windows and Linux, but on macOS, not so much... Instead of behaving as we expect, this is how the file picker behaves on macOS <em>exclusively</em>.</p>
         <p><img src="/static/lilly-mac-file-picker-broken.gif" alt="lilly-mac-file-picker-broken.gif"></p>
         <p>As you can see, instead of sorting the list of entries based on the query as it's being entered, it seems that just the top entry is being randomly swapped back and forth between two specific paths, and the two paths are nowhere near close to the search query contents either.</p>
         <p>This is particularly unexpected as a bug, because the V(lang) programming language and the standard library is designed to provide platform-agnostic functionality. If this is a bug on macOS, then this same behaviour should be manifesting on Windows and Linux respectfully.</p>
         <p>So what could be happening here?</p>
         <h1>Debugging</h1>
         <p>There were a couple of immediate avenues of what to investigate that occurred to me at this point, and what I thought were unlikely to be the cause based on existing functionality and logic tests.</p>
         <h3>Suspect list</h3>
         <ol>
         <li><p>Unique file path structure</p>
         <p>Perhaps this issue is manifesting on macOS (when opened on the Lilly project) due to file paths containing repeated instances of <code>.</code> and a frequency of CAPITAL letter directories?</p>
         </li>
         <li><p>Rendering broken</p>
         <p>In the past a subtle V(lang) compiler change resulted in some unexpected pointer reference behaviour, so perhaps the file list is sorting correctly, but the rendering is malformed, or otherwise broken in some way.</p>
         </li>
         </ol>
         <h2>Resolution of the Bug</h2>
         <p>After extensive debugging and investigation, I stumbled upon a Stack Overflow article that shed light on the discrepancies in behavior between the C standard library's <code>qsort</code> implementation on Linux and macOS. This was a pivotal moment in my debugging journey, as it pointed me toward the root cause of the issue.</p>
         <h3>The Original Comparator Logic</h3>
         <p>Initially, the comparator logic in Lilly was structured as follows:</p>
         <pre><code class="language-v">
         if a_score &lt; b_score { return 1 }
         if b_score &gt; a_score { return -1 }
         return 0
         </code></pre>
         <p>At first glance, this logic seemed reasonable; however, it inadvertently led to unexpected sorting behaviour on macOS. The intention was to sort the file paths in descending order based on their scores, but the implementation did not align with the expectations of the sorting algorithm across different platforms.</p>
         <h3>Understanding the Undefined Behaviour</h3>
         <p>As highlighted in the Stack Overflow discussion, the original comparator function was incorrect and could lead to undefined behaviour. While the interface for <code>qsort</code> requires a comparator function that returns an integer with three possible values, the implementation of <code>qsort</code> in glibc does not necessarily utilise all of that information. Instead, it may rely on a simpler two-way branch, which can lead to inconsistent results depending on the size of the array being sorted.</p>
         <p>In particular, the glibc implementation of <code>qsort</code> uses a merge sort that performs less-than-or-equal-to tests. This means that the faulty comparator could work under certain conditions, specifically when the array is not too large. However, if the array exceeds a certain size, the sort could fail entirely, leading to unpredictable behaviour. This nuance was critical in understanding why the file picker functioned correctly on Linux but faltered on macOS.</p>
         <h3>The Revised Comparator Logic</h3>
         <p>Upon reviewing the article, I realised that a subtle adjustment to the comparator logic was necessary. I modified the comparator to:</p>
         <pre><code class="language-v">
         if b_score &gt; a_score { return 1 }
         if a_score == b_score { return 0 }
         return -1
         </code></pre>
         <p>This change ensured that the sorting algorithm correctly interpreted the scores, leading to a consistent and expected order of file paths across all platforms. The revised logic explicitly checks if <code>b_score</code> is greater than <code>a_score</code>, returning <code>1</code> to indicate that <code>b</code> should come before <code>a</code>. If the scores are equal, it returns <code>0</code>, indicating that their order is indeterminate. Finally, if <code>a_score</code> is greater, it returns <code>-1</code>, placing <code>a</code> before <code>b</code>.</p>
         <h3>Testing the Fix</h3>
         <p>After implementing the new comparator logic, I conducted thorough testing on all platforms—Linux, Windows, and macOS. To my relief, the file picker now functioned as intended, with the list of files being sorted accurately based on the search query. The behaviour was consistent and reliable, eliminating the previous confusion that had plagued the macOS implementation.</p>
         <h3>Conclusion</h3>
         <p>This experience has been a valuable lesson in the intricacies of cross-platform development, particularly when it comes to sorting algorithms and their underlying logic. The journey from encountering a perplexing bug to discovering the solution through community resources has reinforced the importance of collaboration and knowledge sharing in the software development process.</p>
         <p>As the Lilly editor continues to evolve, I remain committed to refining its features and ensuring a seamless experience for users across all platforms. I hope that sharing this journey provides useful insights for others who may encounter similar challenges in their projects.</p>
         <p>Thank you for following along, and I look forward to sharing more updates as the Lilly editor progresses! I recently added the ability to leave comments on my posts, please feel free if you so wish!</p>$<{footer}>      </div>
