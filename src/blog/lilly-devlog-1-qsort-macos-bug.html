         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <p>I have been working on a project for nearly a year which I see as my (and perhaps others?) alternative or entire replacement of Neovim for day to day work. This editor is in the pre-alpha release stage of the project. As such there is currently no commitment to provide frequent or consistent dev logs or change log summaries. With that being said, I recently encountered for the first time a bug which I feel is worth writing an article about.</p>
         <p>I will hopefully provide useful insight in this post into what the bug was, how it manifested in Lilly, and what the journey to fix it looked like.</p>
         <h2>What bug?</h2>
         <p>The Lilly editor (LE) has a core feature which is called the &quot;file picker&quot;. This lists all of the files available within the current &quot;workspace&quot;, and the list is ordered based on the closest match to the searched name.</p>
