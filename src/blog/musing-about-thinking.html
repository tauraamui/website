         <p>For a long time I've been experiencing a very noticeable shift in the way that I think. When I say this I am talking about this on a literal level, I mean it. Its not just <em>what I think</em>, or how I form my opinions, or what those opinions are, its a deliberate adjustment to my natural way of interpreting the world to align with consistent but ever surprising results or feedback I get from the world when I do change things.</p>
         <p>If I think hard about it (ironic) there are a few examples I can present:</p>
         <ul>
         <li>Recognising what people mean when they ask &quot;why&quot;</li>
         <li>Some others I ironically cannot remember right this minute</li>
         </ul>$<{footer}>      </div>
